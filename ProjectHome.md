This is a very simple piano simulator written rather for fun and to learn python language.

For sound I used midi files which are being opened/closed every time a key is pressed so there is a bit of delay. This is my first python program and game which I wrote quite a while ago. So don't be too strict ;-)

Unfortunately I found only windows installer, source code is lost.
